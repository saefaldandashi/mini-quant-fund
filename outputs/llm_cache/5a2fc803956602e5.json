In a trend-neutral, low-volatility environment, chasing mean reversion ignores the inherent risk of extended sideways movement and opportunity cost of missing out on stable income generation, particularly given the elevated geopolitical risk which favors assets with defensive characteristics and predictable cash flows, something these tech stocks lack at their current valuations.
