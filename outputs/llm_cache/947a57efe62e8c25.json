First, we've incorporated a minimum variance constraint, which, while still relying on correlations, reduces the portfolio's overall sensitivity to extreme correlation shifts compared to a pure risk parity approach; Second, given the neutral trend and low volatility environment, the benefits of diversification and risk balancing currently outweigh the potential for significant downside risk, especially with our modest Geo Risk exposure of 0.50.\", \"evidence\": [\"The minimum variance constraint actively limits the portfolio's exposure to assets that exhibit high correlation during stress periods, reducing the impact of correlation spikes.\", \"Our current risk sentiment of 0.18 suggests a relatively stable market environment where historical correlations are more likely to hold, minimizing the likelihood of a 2008-style event.\"], \"strength\": 0.75}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-21T15:37:36.857470", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
