Furthermore, our diversified portfolio, including ALB and MDB, mitigates sector-specific risk associated with a semiconductor downturn, and our momentum signals are based on a broader universe than just semiconductors, indicating more robust underlying trends.\",\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"The current risk-on sentiment, despite geopolitical tensions, suggests investors are still willing to chase performance, benefiting momentum strategies. A Risk Sentiment score of -0.48 is negative, but not severely so, and can be interpreted as a 'buy the dip' mentality.\",\n    \"Our allocation to ALB and MDB provides diversification outside the semiconductor sector, reducing the portfolio's overall sensitivity to a semiconductor-specific momentum crash. These stocks exhibit strong momentum signals independent of the semiconductor industry.\",\n    \"While low volatility can sometimes precede momentum crashes, it also allows for smoother trend following and reduces the impact of short-term price fluctuations on our positions.
