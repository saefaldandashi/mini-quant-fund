EA, HOLX, and ATO have shown consistent positive momentum across various lookback periods (3, 6, and 12 months), indicating a potentially sustainable trend.\",\n    \"Our portfolio is not solely reliant on these three positions. The relatively small allocation to ATO (0.9%) and the diversification across other assets, including defensive names like WEC and L, significantly reduces the overall portfolio's sensitivity to adverse movements in EA, HOLX, or ATO.
