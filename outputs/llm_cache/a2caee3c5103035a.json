{"response": "```json\n{\"claim\": \"While I acknowledge the concerns regarding static correlations and leverage in a low volatility environment, our RiskParityMinVar implementation incorporates several mitigations: First, we use a lookback period for correlation estimation that is sensitive to regime shifts, albeit with a lag, and second, the modest leverage employed is actively managed and recalibrated based on real-time volatility signals, not a static target. Finally, the portfolio's diversification across sectors, while not explicitly momentum-driven, provides a degree of inherent protection against idiosyncratic shocks affecting single stocks.\", \"evidence\": [\"Our correlation lookback period is dynamically adjusted based on a rolling 3-month volatility regime, allowing for faster adaptation than a fixed long-term window.\", \"Leverage is capped at 1.5x and reduced further when volatility, as measured by the VIX and realized volatility of the portfolio itself, breaches predefined thresholds.\"], \"strength\": 0.7}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-20T19:18:21.526962", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
