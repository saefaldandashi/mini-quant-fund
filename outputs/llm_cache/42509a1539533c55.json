For example, while WDC and MU have experienced strong price appreciation, their forward P/E ratios remain attractive relative to their growth prospects, suggesting fundamental support.\",\n    \"We actively monitor volatility and adjust position sizes accordingly. Our current portfolio beta is near 1, and we have implemented stop-loss orders on each position to limit downside risk. Furthermore, the relatively small position sizes (0.7% each) limit the overall portfolio impact of any individual stock's reversal.\",\n    \"The selected stocks benefit from secular trends, such as increasing demand for memory and storage (WDC, MU, STX) and the growth of the electric vehicle market (ALB). These underlying drivers provide a buffer against purely sentiment-driven reversals. LRCX also benefits from the secular growth in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.\"\n  ],\n  \"strength\": 0.8\n}\n", "timestamp": "2026-01-21T15:35:52.639789", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
