For example, while the tech sector might face headwinds, GOOGL and LRCX exhibit superior relative strength compared to other tech companies, suggesting company-specific drivers beyond just overall market sentiment.\",\n    \"We employ dynamic risk management techniques, including trailing stop-loss orders and volatility-adjusted position sizing, to limit potential losses and reduce exposure as volatility increases. Historical backtests, even during periods of low volatility followed by market corrections, demonstrate that these risk management protocols significantly reduce drawdown severity compared to a static momentum strategy.\"\n  ],\n  \"strength\": 0.7\n}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-20T15:10:32.798158", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
