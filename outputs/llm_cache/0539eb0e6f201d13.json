The current 'risk-on' environment, despite geopolitical tensions, supports continued, albeit potentially choppy, upward price action, and our positions reflect sectors with relatively lower beta and strong fundamentals, mitigating the impact of sudden reversals.\",\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"Our portfolio's allocation to defensive sectors like healthcare (MCK) and utilities (ATO), alongside consumer staples (EA), provides a buffer against severe market downturns triggered by geopolitical events, as these sectors tend to outperform during periods of uncertainty. The low volatility environment, while potentially leading to smaller gains, also reduces the magnitude of potential whipsaws, and our position sizing is calibrated to account for this.\",\n    \"Empirical evidence suggests that while geopolitical events can cause short-term market disruptions, the underlying trends often reassert themselves, and TimeSeriesMomentum is designed to capture these longer-term movements. Furthermore, the negative risk sentiment (-0.48) indicates a degree of caution already priced into the market, reducing the likelihood of a major surprise shock.\"\n  ],\n  \"strength\": 0.7\n}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-20T16:31:29.101910", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
