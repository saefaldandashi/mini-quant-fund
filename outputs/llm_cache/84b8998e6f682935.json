{"response": "```json\n{\"claim\": \"While I acknowledge the historical sensitivity of momentum strategies to whipsaws in neutral, low-volatility environments, our current implementation incorporates several risk mitigation factors that significantly reduce this vulnerability. First, our momentum signal is not solely based on price; it's a composite score incorporating volume and earnings revisions, providing a more robust signal than simple price trend following. Second, our position sizing algorithm dynamically adjusts based on realized volatility, reducing exposure when volatility is low, as it is now, and geopolitical risk is elevated.\", \"evidence\": [\"composite momentum signal (price, volume, earnings revisions)\", \"dynamic position sizing based on realized volatility\"], \"strength\": 0.75}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-21T19:15:27.011491", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
