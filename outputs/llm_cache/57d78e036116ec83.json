The 2013 taper tantrum and periods of rising rates have repeatedly demonstrated the fragility of risk parity when bond-equity correlations break down, leading to simultaneous losses across asset classes and amplified drawdowns due to leverage.\",\n  \"evidence\": [\"correlation breakdown\", \"leverage risk\"],\n  \"strength\": 0.85\n}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-20T16:39:15.330501", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
