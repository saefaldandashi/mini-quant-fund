Furthermore, focusing solely on volume ignores the elevated geopolitical risk, which can trigger sudden, volume-driven reversals unrelated to underlying market fundamentals, as we saw in Q1 2022 with the initial invasion of Ukraine; chasing volume spikes then would have been disastrous.\",\n  \"evidence\": [\"Low volatility environments often lead to increased noise in volume signals, making it difficult to distinguish genuine breakout attempts from temporary fluctuations.\", \"Geopolitical risk can induce significant volume spikes unrelated to market fundamentals, leading to false signals and potential losses.\"],\n  \"strength\": 0.8\n}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-21T19:14:09.150143", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
