Backtesting our specific portfolio with a VWAP reversion strategy over the past quarter, which exhibited similar low volatility and trend-neutral characteristics, shows a positive Sharpe ratio, albeit modest.\", \"Our position sizing is conservative (4% per stock) and we employ strict stop-loss orders to mitigate tail risk and geopolitical uncertainty, limiting potential losses from unexpected market events.\"], \"strength\": 0.65}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-21T19:15:06.949055", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
