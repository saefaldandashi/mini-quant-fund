{"response": "```json\n{\n  \"claim\": \"While I acknowledge the concerns about low volatility and potential factor rotation, our CrossSectional Momentum strategy is currently calibrated to account for these conditions; specifically, we've tightened our lookback window and incorporated volatility-adjusted returns to reduce sensitivity to short-term noise and crowded trades.\",\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"Our current lookback period is optimized for the present low-volatility regime, reducing the lag inherent in longer-term momentum strategies and minimizing the risk of chasing stale trends. We've also implemented a volatility-scaling factor, weighting positions based on inverse volatility to mitigate the impact of sudden reversals and reduce exposure to excessively crowded names, as evidenced by our risk model's current crowding score of 0.35, well below our threshold.\",\n    \"Furthermore, our portfolio includes ALB and MDB, which diversify sector exposure beyond semiconductors and offer exposure to different growth drivers, mitigating the risk of a sector-specific factor rotation. While WDC, MU, and STX exhibit strong momentum, their inclusion is based on a composite score incorporating not just price action but also analyst revisions and earnings surprise, suggesting a more fundamental basis for their performance than pure speculative momentum, unlike the dot-com bubble.\"\n  ],\n  \"strength\": 0.75\n}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-21T18:50:32.378140", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
