This responsiveness helps to identify and adjust for shifts in asset correlations, reducing the impact of unexpected correlation breakdowns.\",\n    \"The model's volatility targeting mechanism is calibrated to a conservative level (e.g., 8-10% annualized volatility), and includes a buffer to further reduce leverage when realized volatility exceeds the target. This proactive deleveraging helps to protect the portfolio from significant drawdowns during periods of heightened market stress, as demonstrated by backtesting against scenarios similar to the 2013 taper tantrum and Q1 2020, where drawdowns were significantly less than a static leverage approach.\"\n  ],\n  \"strength\": 0.75\n}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-20T19:44:03.582543", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
