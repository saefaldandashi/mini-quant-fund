{"response": "```json\n{\"claim\": \"While I acknowledge the valid concerns about correlation stability in a changing market environment, particularly with elevated geopolitical risk, our RiskParityMinVar model incorporates several mitigating factors: the minimum variance component actively seeks to minimize portfolio volatility regardless of individual asset volatility, and the risk parity element ensures diversification across different risk factors, not just asset classes, which reduces reliance on specific correlation patterns. Furthermore, we actively monitor portfolio correlations and have pre-defined triggers for rebalancing should significant deviations from historical averages occur, mitigating the risk of amplified losses during correlation shifts.\", \"evidence\": [\"Minimum variance optimization directly addresses overall portfolio volatility, independent of individual asset volatility.\", \"Risk parity across risk factors provides a more robust diversification strategy than simple asset class diversification, reducing reliance on specific asset correlations.\", \"Active monitoring and pre-defined rebalancing triggers allow for dynamic adjustments to the portfolio in response to changing market conditions and correlation shifts.\"], \"strength\": 0.75}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-20T17:55:16.540304", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
