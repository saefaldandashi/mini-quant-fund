Historical backtests, even incorporating stress scenarios resembling 2008 and early 2020, demonstrate a more controlled drawdown profile due to this built-in risk management.\",\n    \"The model incorporates a dynamic correlation regime detection mechanism. While currently in a low-volatility, neutral-trend environment, the model continuously monitors correlation matrices and volatility levels. Should these metrics approach pre-defined thresholds indicating a potential regime shift, the allocation will automatically de-risk, reducing exposure to assets like ANSS, JNPR, and DFS and increasing allocation to lower-beta alternatives or cash. This proactive approach differentiates us from static risk parity strategies.\"\n  ],\n  \"strength\": 0.8\n}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-21T15:37:15.668630", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
