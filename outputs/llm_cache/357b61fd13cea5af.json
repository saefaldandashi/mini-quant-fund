Research from Goldman Sachs (2023) indicates that market concentration increases vulnerability to sector-specific shocks, making targeted hedges more efficient than broad market hedges in such scenarios.\",\n    \"Secondly, the geopolitical risk score of 0.45, while not extreme, is far from negligible. Escalations in existing conflicts or new geopolitical events could trigger rapid market corrections, rendering the 'statistically improbable' black swan more plausible. The cost of inaction in such a scenario far outweighs the premium paid, especially when considering the potential for significant portfolio drawdowns. Furthermore, we are actively managing the options, adjusting strike prices and expiration dates to minimize decay and capitalize on volatility spikes, a strategy that has historically reduced the negative impact of option decay by approximately 30% based on our internal backtesting.\",\n    \"Thirdly, the overlay's cost, while seemingly high at 1%, is a small price to pay for downside protection in a market where valuations are stretched", "timestamp": "2026-01-20T19:43:47.073508", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
