Historically, such concentrated bets on sector-specific momentum in the absence of a strong market trend have often underperformed diversified momentum strategies and exposed portfolios to unnecessary volatility.\", \"evidence\": [\"Idiosyncratic risk in WDC, MU, ALB\", \"Lack of broad market trend support\"], \"strength\": 0.7}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-21T20:44:41.442395", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
