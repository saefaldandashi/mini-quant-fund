Our strategy does not rely on similar complex derivatives and is therefore less susceptible to such a shock. We also employ dynamic hedging strategies that adjust based on market volatility, providing an additional layer of protection against sudden reversals.\"\n  ],\n  \"strength\": 0.8\n}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-21T18:51:46.302670", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
