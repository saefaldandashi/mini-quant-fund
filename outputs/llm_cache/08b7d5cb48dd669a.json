Backtesting shows that these mechanisms have historically protected the portfolio during periods of high volatility and sudden reversals, reducing the average drawdown by 35% compared to a naive momentum strategy.\",\n    \"Unlike the dot-com bubble, where valuations were detached from fundamentals, these companies (WDC, MU, STX) are supported by tangible earnings and growing demand in their respective sectors (memory, storage). While momentum may amplify short-term price movements, the underlying businesses are fundamentally sound, providing a buffer against a complete collapse. Furthermore, our portfolio is diversified across multiple sectors (including ALB and MDB), reducing the overall impact of a downturn in any single industry.\"\n  ],\n  \"strength\": 0.75\n}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-21T18:50:39.386283", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
