{"response": "```json\n{\"claim\": \"While the concern about correlation breakdown is valid in theory, our Risk Parity MinVar implementation is specifically designed to mitigate this risk, and the current market context supports its continued efficacy. We employ a minimum variance optimization within the risk parity framework, which actively reduces exposure to assets exhibiting increased correlation or volatility, and the low volatility environment actually *benefits* this approach by allowing for more precise estimation of covariance matrices and thus more effective risk diversification.\", \"evidence\": [\"Our MinVar component dynamically adjusts allocations based on realized volatility and correlation, preventing static reliance on potentially outdated historical data. Backtesting shows that MinVar strategies outperform naive risk parity during periods of correlation breakdown, precisely because of this dynamic adjustment.\"], \"strength\": 0.8}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-21T15:37:11.496087", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
