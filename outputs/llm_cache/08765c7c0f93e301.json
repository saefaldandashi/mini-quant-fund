Given the current 'weak_up, low_vol, risk_on' market regime, our model's modest leverage is justified by the diversification benefits and the observed stability in correlations across our chosen assets (ANSS, JNPR, DFS, WBA, CTLT), which are selected for their lower beta and idiosyncratic risk profiles, making them less susceptible to broad market factor rotations.\",\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"Our Minimum Variance optimization uses a rolling window of historical data to estimate correlations, providing a more adaptive approach than static Risk Parity.\",\n    \"The current low volatility environment, while potentially masking underlying risks, also allows for more precise estimation of correlations and risk contributions, improving the accuracy of our Minimum Variance adjustments.
