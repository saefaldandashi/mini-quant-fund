Historical analysis of similar strategies during periods of low volatility, like 2017, demonstrates that a proactive, managed approach can significantly reduce the cost of protection while maintaining effectiveness.\",\n    \"The allocation to individual names (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AVGO, ORCL) is not solely based on market capitalization but also on their sensitivity to specific macro and geopolitical risks. These companies, while seemingly robust, have significant exposure to supply chain disruptions, regulatory changes, and shifts in consumer sentiment, making them vulnerable to sharp, idiosyncratic declines even in a neutral market. The current geopolitical risk score of 0.50 suggests a higher-than-average probability of such events.\"\n  ],\n  \"strength\": 0.8\n}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-21T15:35:01.643270", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
