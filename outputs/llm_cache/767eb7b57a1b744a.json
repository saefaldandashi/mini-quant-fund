The portfolio's low overall volatility, coupled with trend neutrality, suggests that the potential for whipsaw losses is manageable given our position sizing and stop-loss parameters, and the current geopolitical risk is already factored into our risk model.\",\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"Our momentum signal incorporates volatility-adjusted returns and cross-sectional rank, which reduces the likelihood of being whipsawed by short-term noise compared to a simple price-based momentum strategy. This is particularly important in a low-volatility environment.\",\n    \"We employ dynamic position sizing and stop-loss orders based on individual stock volatility and market conditions, limiting downside risk and allowing us to quickly exit positions if trends reverse. This active risk management is crucial in mitigating the impact of unexpected shocks.\"\n  ],\n  \"strength\": 0.8\n}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-21T20:48:11.832757", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
