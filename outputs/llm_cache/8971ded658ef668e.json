This approach ignores the potential for 'volatility clustering' and sudden regime shifts, reminiscent of the 2018 Q4 correction where similar volatility-targeting strategies were forced to deleverage into a falling market, exacerbating losses and underperforming value-oriented strategies.\",\n  \"evidence\": [\"sudden vol spikes\", \"regime shifts\"],\n  \"strength\": 0.85\n}\n```", "timestamp": "2026-01-20T15:48:38.713705", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
