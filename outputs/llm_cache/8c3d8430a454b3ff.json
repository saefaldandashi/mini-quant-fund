Our stock selection, while exhibiting momentum, also incorporates fundamental analysis to ensure reasonable valuations and avoid purely speculative assets, unlike the dot-com bubble.\",\n    \"Secondly, the neutral trend environment doesn't negate the presence of relative strength within specific sectors. WDC, MU, and STX, for example, are benefiting from specific industry tailwinds (e.g., memory chip demand, data storage growth) that are likely to persist even if the broader market remains range-bound.
