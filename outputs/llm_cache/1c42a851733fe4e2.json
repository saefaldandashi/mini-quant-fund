Academic research demonstrates that cross-sectional momentum can be profitable even in periods of low market volatility, as it exploits relative price discrepancies rather than relying on broad market trends (e.g., Asness, Moskowitz, & Pedersen, 2013, 'Value and Momentum Everywhere').\",\n    \"While WDC, MU, and STX are in the semiconductor/data storage space, their individual momentum is driven by company-specific factors like technological advancements, market share gains, and strategic partnerships, which are less susceptible to a broad sector collapse. Furthermore, ALB and MDB provide diversification outside of the immediate tech sector, reducing overall portfolio concentration risk. We actively monitor correlation matrices and will adjust positions if correlations significantly increase.\",\n    \"Our position sizing is conservative (20% per stock) and reflects the current geopolitical risk", "timestamp": "2026-01-21T21:19:15.170777", "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"}
