The company's upcoming investor conferences in Toronto next week are also drawing attention, as investors seek clarity on future costs and production plans amidst volatile market conditions. Goldman Sachs analysts, however, forecast that current record copper prices above $13,000 may not be sustained long-term without clearer tariff signals.",

      "summary": "U.S. stock index futures saw a slight decline after Wall Street closed mostly lower, primarily due to disappointing earnings from Microsoft, which raised concerns about the returns on significant AI investments. In contrast, Apple's results, released after market close, exceeded expectations with strong iPhone sales and a rebound in Greater China, leading to a modest rise in its shares during extended trading. SanDisk also surged due to beating profit forecasts, while Visa dipped despite strong earnings, impacted by transaction shortfalls and consumer spending worries.",

      "summary": "BMO Chief Economist Doug Porter believes the Bank of Canada's decision to hold interest rates steady offers a \"silver lining\" for Canada's housing market, providing buyers and sellers with more certainty despite continued affordability challenges. While a significant market boom isn't expected in 2026, the stability could prevent substantial rate fluctuations. Porter forecasts a modest 1.5% rise in sales nationally, with prices potentially drifting lower in Ontario and British Columbia as affordability remains a key issue.",
