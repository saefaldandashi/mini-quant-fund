      "summary": "The iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ) experienced a strong rally in 2025, driven by global flows, USD weakness, and carry trade, rather than domestic economic growth. Despite this re-rating, EWZ remains attractive compared to developed markets, supported by high real carry and dividends. The outlook for 2026 depends on contained fiscal risk and ongoing global liquidity, suggesting continued constructive performance.",

While the order aims to make homes more affordable by reducing competition from institutional investors, experts suggest that without an increase in housing inventory, such measures may exacerbate the affordability problem. Despite the policy's intent, the primary challenge remains the lack of available homes, a factor largely controlled by local regulations rather than federal policy.",

Despite these overruns, the company views Jansen as a long-term growth asset, with first production now anticipated in mid-2027 instead of mid-2026. Experts suggest the cost hike is likely due to unexpected engineering hurdles rather than inflation, though it may extend the payback period and potentially delay future expansions.",
