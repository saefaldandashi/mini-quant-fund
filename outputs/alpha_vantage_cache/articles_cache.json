The company's upcoming investor conferences in Toronto next week are also drawing attention, as investors seek clarity on future costs and production plans amidst volatile market conditions. Goldman Sachs analysts, however, forecast that current record copper prices above $13,000 may not be sustained long-term without clearer tariff signals.",
