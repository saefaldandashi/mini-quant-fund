      "summary": "American Express stock (AXP) fell by about 2% last week, primarily due to President Donald Trump's proposal for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates, which impacted the broader payments sector. Despite the selloff driven by regulatory concerns rather than company-specific news, a valuation model suggests a target price of $384, implying a 5.2% upside over the next two years. Future performance is tied to premium customer spending, expense management, and stable credit performance.",

The banking industry is awaiting clarity on the January 20 deadline for this cap, which analysts believe would require legislation and is unlikely to pass. Kedia also mentioned that the bank's fourth-quarter profit exceeded expectations due to increased interest payments and fee revenue growth.",

The report particularly highlights an upward revision to US growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026, driven by recent strong economic data, though employment figures have been mixed. It also notes potential slowdowns in other major economies, often due to trade-related factors, and discusses the ongoing debate around Federal Reserve policy and inflation expectations.",

      "headline": "Why 'Cheap' Software Stocks Could Be The Next Big AI Value Trap",
      "summary": "Analyst Jordi Visser from 22V Research warns that recent deep drawdowns in enterprise software stocks like Adobe, Salesforce, and ServiceNow are not cyclical selloffs but rather structural changes due to AI-driven demand suppression. He argues that AI is fundamentally changing how software is built and used, making traditional software models and their associated multiples misleading. Visser suggests that investors should not view these falling prices as value opportunities but as a reflection of a contracting market where AI is eroding the need for administrative friction and seat-based pricing.",
